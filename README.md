###  ** How to use**


#### Search functionality:

This is a very simple program at the outset where all it requires from the user is to input what allergen/allergens they hope to avoid and receive the top rated recipe that the database holds that holds none of the allergens.

#### Favoriting Info:

The user will be provided with an image, the recipe title and ingredients list for the recipe. If the user likes, the recipe can be saved to their favorite lists (or the user can see all favorites). If they click the favorite button, there are multiple follow up options. The user can email a grocery list of items and click the map to find local health food stores where one can purchase the ingredients themselves.
